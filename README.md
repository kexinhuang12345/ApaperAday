# A Paper A Day, Keep the "Doctor" Away

I urge myself to read at least one paper per day. This repo lists the paper information. It should mainly be in machine learning, specially ML for healthcare. But I also find inspirations from other subjects mostly chemistry, biomedicine, ... Let me know if you want to discuss or anything.

Note: the "Doctor" in the title does not refer to the clinicians, but the doctors to cure my inability in keeping up and drawing new ML ideas. 

ML for Health should ALWAYS assist doctors, not to push them away : )
